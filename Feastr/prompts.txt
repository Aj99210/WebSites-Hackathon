I wanna build A website With Gemeni Api (Api it will read from api.env) that when user enters any food name, it shows its recipi and how to make that.... I named It Fester... I will have 2 main pages: Landing page and Crafting Page... I alsoo wanna use Spline Models and make it sooo visually appealing... This time im thinking of impliminting white-creamish theme.... Lets First Design its Landing Page... My name is Ajay.. With All Proper NavBar with Two Options: Fester (Landing Page) and Craft Recipies Option.. Everything should loook AAA and professional and high quality



The UI looks soo Plain Simple It needs to be RE-Written And ReHauled.. Make it soooo sooo complex and intreactable... Add 3d Elements also if possible


Bro Im making a website that utilizes the gemini api and when user enters any food name it generates it recepies in beautifull way.... But this script is incomplete... So Complete the script from where you left off and dont re-write the whole script from starting due to your length limits for god sake...

Analyse the whole code and Start Writing from:
 <!-- Footer -->
    <footer class="footer">
        <div class="footer-content">
            <div class="footer-section">
                <h3>Fester</h3>
                <p>Revolutionizing the way you cook with AI-powere



Bro Can You remove About option from the navigation ?




Okay Whenever someone clicks Craft Recipes or Start Crafting, it should redirect to new Craft.html page instead of that same page dialogue...
Also Remove everything related to that "Demo Api"
Make sure everything works


Bro These are the ScreenShots of the Landing Page of My website Fester.... Its a website where user just enters the namee and it utilizes Gemini API (From api.env) and tells perfect recipi... Now its time to make the crafting page... And make sure that that UI of that page is excately same and make sure it reads api from api.env and works properly.. It should look AAA and professional and nice



Bro I sshifted the styles to Craft_Style.css however everything is tooo basic now.. And neeeds to be improved and complex and should loook like AAA company


Broo the navbar of this pagee loooks ugly as hell and doesnt even resembles the original once... I also Uploaded the screenshot of landing page... But this crafting page narbar should just have fester Written beautiffuly at the center and at most right a Home Icon which when clicked on goes to Landing.html.... Also your length limit is way tooooo low (just 1k line max) so you cant re-write wholeee codee... Just tell me the changes


Bro the API key is correct but its still not workingg pleasee fix that.. Also Craft_style.css is a different File soo you dont need to re-write that in <style> of Craft.html file.. Just fix the issue


Broo this is my current Craft.html... But Sir Said That this is the requirenment... But Since the image api is not free so dont add that, only tts is left... add tts.. tts can be a lil smart if you like just a lil bit.. BUT MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS
And dontt re-write <style> its already written in another file...



Sooo Im Making A Website Fester Where Users Have to just Enter There Food Name Or Tell Ingredints and then it uses gemeni API to tell its recepi.... But now its time to make Plan Meals Page Functional..... Make sure its has consistant and nice UI, I even uploaded some screenshots of landing and that recepi page.... 
What can we do in Plan Meals Page? Maybe Utizlize Gemeni Api there also to doo something....

And for the navbar, Just make the Fester Logo At center and Home Icon at the most right which when clicked, redirects to Landing.html... also heres some reference to root of Craft.html page so that you can try to make UI same:
:root {
    --primary-brown: 
#8b5a3c;
    --secondary-brown: 
#a67c5a;
    --accent-brown: 
#d4a574;
    --light-brown: 
#f4ede4;
    --dark-brown: 
#6b4423;
    --gradient-primary: linear-gradient(135deg, 
#8b5a3c 0%, 
#a67c5a 50%, 
#d4a574 100%);
    --gradient-secondary: linear-gradient(135deg, 
#f4ede4 0%, 
#e8ddd4 100%);
    --gradient-dark: linear-gradient(135deg, 
#2c1810 0%, 
#4a2c1a 100%);
    --glass-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);
    --glass-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
    --shadow-light: 0 8px 32px rgba(139, 90, 60, 0.1);
    --shadow-medium: 0 12px 40px rgba(139, 90, 60, 0.15);
    --shadow-heavy: 0 20px 60px rgba(139, 90, 60, 0.25);
    --border-radius: 20px;
    --transition: all 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}


So this page I guess doesnt Utilizes Genemi Api Properly... And the UI is alsoo very bad.... Re-write the UI and make it best and polish it and also make it professional and it should feeel like AAA company.... Also Remove Unnesscarry features but make sure the main feature work perfetcly... While at same time UI should feal nice tooo.... Ui should bee nicee but the color theme should not  be changed... it should be same that creamish theme.. you know what im talking about.... and my api key is : AIzaSyAylB7P7m14nZPrRuxEGB_Q9y9ccC5Fbls


its showing Sorry there was error generating your meal plan please make sure it works correctly


Lets do FrontEnd Change Only Im sure itt works.. I have used something like this in my other page.. You can also see how its used in @Craft.html on how APIs is Used and fix it here in @Meal.html .. there something API_URL is also used:
        const API_URL = 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest:generateContent';
